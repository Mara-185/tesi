\chapter{Belle II Upgrade}

This second chapter wants to adress some of the main reasons in favor of the upgrade of Belle II. We will give an overview of the primary background sources in the experiment to understand how to mitigate them to be able to achieve a better performance of the whole detector, even increasing the luminosity. Eventually we will also introduce some of the proposes made for the vertex detector, which is the focus of this thesis.

\section{Background sources and limitations in Belle II}

SuperKEKB is already the world's highest-luminosity collider and it aims to reach a new luminosity peak and to increase the statistics in the future, to become more sensitive to rare process and precise measurements of Belle II physics program. 
But to be able to do this without loosing the good functionality of the entire detector, it's necessary to understand how to mitigate the beam backgrounds where possible and how to cope with the consequent challenges.

Several simulations and measurements of beam background are still being done in order to guess possible future machine scenarios, under new luminosity conditions.
This is necessary to study the vulnerability of the subdetectors (and more generally of the machine) and so to design the countermeasures to adopt against the deterioration of performance and material.


\subsection{Beam-induced background sources}

Making clear that even the interaction of the beams is a source of noise for the measurements, in the following are listed some of the \textit{beam-induced} and \textit{luminosity-dependent} background sources.


\begin{description}
\item[Touschek effect]: 
	It is an intra-bunches scattering process, where the Coulomb scattering of two particles in the same beam bunch causes a variation of their energies, increasing the value of one of them and lowering that of the other from the nominal value. This interaction among the bunch particles is the first beam background source at SuperKEKB.
\item[Beam-gas scattering]: 
	this represents the collision of beam particles with residual gas molecules in the beam pipe. It's the second beam background source and it can occur via two processes: Coulomb interactions, which changes the direction of the beam particles, and bremsstrahlung scattering, which instead decreases their energy. 
\end{description}
	
Because of these two processes, the scattered particle fall out the stable orbit and hit the beam pipe while they move around the ring. This causes electromagnetic showers that could reach the detector if their origin (loss position) is close to it.


\begin{description}
\item[Radiative Bhabha scattering and two-photon processes]:
	There are several undesirable collision processes at IP, which have very high cross sections but only little interest for the physics studied in the experiment. Two of them are \textbf{Bhabha scattering} ($e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-} \lambda$) and \textbf{Two-photon processes} ($e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{-} $). 
	In the first effect the emitted photon interacts with the iron magnets and produces a very large amounts of neutrons via the photo-nuclear resonance mechanism. [Such neutrons are the main background source for the outermost Belle II detector, the $K_{L}$ and muon detector (KLM).] The electrons-positrons pairs of the latter instead, can spiral around the solenoid field lines and leave multiple hits in the inner Belle II detectors.\\
	
These processes increase the Belle II occupancy and radiation dose, and they are reffered as \textit{Luminosity background} because their strenght is proportional to the luminosity. The future upgrade intends to deal with this problem in order to keep occupancy low.

\item[Synchrotron Radiation (SR)]:
	X-rays emitted from the beam when electrons and positrons pass through the strong magnetic field near the IP. The HER beam is the main source of this type of background, because SR power is proportional to the square of beam energy and magnetic field.
SR can potentially damage the inner layers of the vertex detector due to an higher radiation dose. As a matter of fact, many current studies aim to enhance radiation hardness detector.
\end{description}

There are also other  background sources beyond those mentioned aboce and during the last decade a well-structured set of countermeasures have been developed trying to ease each one of them.


\subsection{Current background status and future implications (predictions)}

Several monitoring devices are located all along the accelerator to keep under control radiation doses on both detector and delicate regions of the ring, to intervene as soon as possible in case too high levels are reached. Indeed large doses of radiation could cause accidental damages on the detector, decreasing its performance.

Event though, the current level is of no concern in terms of occupancy for the innermost layers of the vertex detector, in the case of a larger amount, SR may cause inhomogenities in PXD module irradiation, which would make it more difficult to compensate by adjusting the operation voltages of the affected modules.

Until now it can be said that SuperKEKB and Belle II are operating stably. Beam-induced backgorund rates are well below the limits of the detector and do not prevent from increasing further tha current and hence the luminosity.  
Despite that, there are several other difficulties that can limit beam currents and so the possibility to move the luminosity frontier at towards higher levels, allowing Belle II reaserchers to study rare physics processes.

\section{Purposes of the upgrade}

\begin{comment}
We have seen that SuperKEKB is expected to be able to reach.... with the existing accelerator complex, but in order to achieve higher luminosity, an upgrade (enhancement) of the interaction region will (probably) be required.\\
Belle II is also designed to operate efficiently under the high levels of backgrounds extrapolated to target luminosity, but safety margins are not large. Moreover in the case of a redesign of the interaction region large uncertainties in the background extrapolations are unavoidable. \\
The upgrade program is therefore motivated by many considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Improve detector robustness against backgrounds
\item Increase longer termsubdetector radiation resistance
\item Provide large safety factors for running at higher luminosity
\item Develop the technology to cope with different future papths, for instance if a major IR redesign is required to reach the target luminosity
\item Improve overall physics performance
\end{itemize}

The Belle II upgrade aims to ensure that the detector could have high impact results in heavy flavour and dark sector physics, at the higher level of luminosity ever achieved. The luminosity dependent background conditions may be severe, in terms of detector operations and physics performance. Moreover the current detector configuration is not expected to maintain its performance level when facing high beam background level or high rates.\\

In regards to the Vertex Detector (in particular), all proposed upgrades aim to:

\begin{itemize}
\item reduce occupancy level by employing fully pixelated and fast detector (nowadays CMOS technologies most probably choice)
\item increase robustness against tracking efficiency and resolution losses from beam background (better handling of background)
\item this implies improved tracking efficiency with $p_{T}$< 200 MeV/c.
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
SuperKEKB is already the world's highest-luminosity collider and it aims to reach a new peaks luminosity [of 6.3 $\dot 10^{35}$ $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$] in the future by further increasing the beam-currents and reducing the beam-size at the interaction point by squeezing the betatron function down to $\beta^{*}_{y}$ = 0.3 mm (mentioned in section REFERENCE). For this reason, it's necessary to understand how to mitigate the beam backgrounds where possible and how to cope with the consequent challenges.

[So it is a of a great importance simulate and measure the background to check on the state of the detector and the machine but also to predict how the conditions could change.]
In figure .... the Belle II background level measured in..... is shown. Current background rates in the experiment are acceptable and above all in most cases well below the limits (listed??).
