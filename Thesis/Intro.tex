Belle II is a particle physics experiment located at KEK laboratory in Tsukuba (Japan), 100 km away from Tokyo. The detector is a general-purpose spectrometer and it is placed along the SuperKEKB accelerator, a second generation flavor-factory which operates at the luminosity frontier, holding the world record of istantaneous luminosity with $L_{ist}$ = \num{4.7e34} $cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. 

SuperKEKB is the upgrade of the preceding facility KEKB (operational from 1998 to 2016) and it consists in a 3 km-circumference asymmetric accelerator which collides electrons and positrons beams (with energy of 7 GeV and 4 GeV, respectively) at a center-of-mass energy near the $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance ($\sqrt{s}$ = 10.58 GeV). It started its data taking in March 2019.

In the first years of the next decade, the collider aims to collect  an unrivaled dataset of 50 $ab^{-1}$ (x50 Belle dataset, x100 BaBar dataset) and to reach a new peak of istantaneous luminosity, in order to study the charge-parity violation in B mesons system with more precision and to search for new hints of pyhsics beyond the Standard Model.

To achieve these challenging targets, it would be necessary a significant upgrade of the accelerator and its main components (in particular nearby the Interaction Region) and also of the detector. As a matter of fact, to the increase in luminosity corresponds not only large data collected and greater possibility to study rare processes, but also higher doses of radiation and greater level of backgrounds which could undermine the integrity and the operation of the Belle II detector.
In particular the subdetectors which are nearer to the beam pipe are those more exposed to severe conditions, like the vertex detector (VXD), composed by the inner pixel detector (PXD, made by layers of pixel) and the outermost silicon vertex detector (SVD, made by layers of strips). They deal with the reconstruction of charged particle tracks and of decay vertices with high performance. Recent studies have shown that the current detector could operate efficiently up to a luminosity of $L_{ist}$ = \num{2e35} $cm^{-2} s^{-1}$, but safety margins are not so large. 
It is precisely in this context that different upgrade projects have been proposed, which intend to strengthen new detectors, for the purposes of make them more resistant even in harsher working conditions, while the luminosity will be gradualy increased. 

This thesis focuses especially on the VerTeX Detector (VTX) proposal (the one chosen for the final upgrade), whose program provides for replacing the whole VXD with fully-pixelated five layers at different distance from the beam pipe, equipped with the same tipe of sensor technology, which is the CMOS Depleted Monolihic Active Pixel Sensors (DMAPS). 

The good results achieved by the ALICE experiment (LHC), which employed the same technology, have pushed for this solution which has proven to be reliable and promising in maintaining low occupancy in substantial level of backgrounds and good radiation hardness even after irradiation. 

In order to fullfil the physics requirements of Belle II experiments, a new silicon sensor is being designed, called OBELIX, exploiting the 180 nm TowerJazz Semiconductor process. Developments will ensure a faster, lighter and highly granular chip, reducing the material budget and as consequence improving tracks and vertices reconstruction despite the worse expected background environment. 

OBELIX planning is based on studies done on previous prototypes, among which TJ-Monopix 2, whose characterization is the main topic of this work. Continuous laboratory measurements and beam test have conducted and are still in progress, in order to study the response of the matrix before and after irradiation, its power consumption and also to fully characterize its electrical features. 
In particular, the analysis presented in this thesis, has completely characterized the response of the pixel matrix, returning important results that have allowed to interpret data obtained from tests during the Test Beam at Desy in July 2022 and that are being used in the design of the OBELIX chip.
