\chapter{CMOS MAPS sensors}

The fourth chapter aims to introduce the essential features of the semiconductor detector technology, going through the history of its advancements, which have led to the currently most promising sensors based on CMOS logic structure, the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). As we have seen in the previous chapter, the VTX program wants to make the most of the technologies that have already proven reliable in precision measurements, like the TJ-Monopix development line. We will briefly present it, mentioning the peculiarities of its prototypes, to better understand how they could fulfill the Belle II requirements.
