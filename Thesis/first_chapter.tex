\chapter{Belle II and SuperKEKB (SKB) accelerator}

The first chapter aims to present a brief introduction of the Belle II physics program, focusing on those measurements wich could particularly benefit from the upgrade of the whole detector and expecially of the VerteX Detector (VXD). A short description of the SuperKEKB accelerator and the Belle II detector's structure are also presented and to conclude some highlights on the actual state of measurements.

\section{Physics program of the B-factories}

Belle II is a B-factory dedicated to improve precision measurements of the Standard Model's parameters (SM) and to looking for the physics Beyond the Standard Model.
In particular the experiment investigates the Charge-Parity Violation (CPV) in the B mesons system and it also searches for new physics evidences in the decays of B and D mesons, in $\tau$ leptons and in the dark matter sector (DM), above all, hunting for dark photons.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Opened questions in SM}

The SM is a physics theory that describe three of the fundamental forces involving elementary particles, which are strong, weak and electromagnetic interaction (with the exclusion of the gravitational one). It classifies all particles known so far, in 4 main groups: quark, leptons, bosons and Higgs (figure \vref{fig:sm}).


\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Particle classification in the Standard Model.}
\label{fig:sm}
\end{figure}


Despite its undeniable success in predicting with high precision new particles and unknow mechanisms over the years, there are many aspects of the Nature on which it is unable to give answers. Some of them are listed in the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Three generations of quark and leptons are known, but it is not obvious wheter they should be the only ones and the reasons behind their mass hierarchy.
\item Higgs mechanism is able to explain the cause of elementary particles' masses through spontaneous electro-weak symmetry breaking, but it doesn't justify those of neutrinos.
\item The SM also predicts other Higgs-like bosons, potentially vector bosons, whose existance would be justified in some SUper-SYmmetry (SUSY) theories or in others of New Physics.
\item Another opened question is the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Even though CP violation is necessary to explain the its current state, the observed quantity is several orders of magnitude less than needed to explain the matter domination over antimatter, which allowed the evolution of the universe as we know it today.
\item In the SM the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix describes the flavour-changing weak interaction through the mismatch between the quantum state of the freely propagating quarks. It could be parametrized by three mixing angles and a complex phase that is at the foundation of CP Violation in the quark flavor sector. The fact that its elements are almost diagonal might suggest the existance of a new symmetry, that is unbroken at high energy (greater than the order of TeV).
\end{itemize}

All these topics encourage the research of new particles and processes that could give reasonable answers.\\
At the energy frontier, experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneve are looking for new particles created from the proton-proton collision with a center mass energy up to 14 TeV.\\
At luminosity frontier instead, the hint of new particles and mechanisms is searched in precision measurements of suppressed reactions in flavour physics or in the deviations from SM. The discrepancies indeed, could be interpreted as a clue of new physics beyond SM. The last is the Belle II approach.\\


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Belle II Physics channels}

SuperKEKB has a very broad field of research and in the following we will go through the main physics goals of the experiment, underlining how the measurements could be enhanced by the upgrade of the vertex detector.\\

\hspace{.2cm}

\textbf{FLAVOR PHYSICS}
\begin{description}
\item [CP-violating phases in quark sector:]\
	\begin{itemize}
	%\itemsep0em
	\item as we mentioned above, the amount of CP violation in the SM is not enough to explain the difference observed between baryon-antibaryon matter. New clues of CPV could be found studying the discrepancy between $B^{0}$ and $\bar{B_{0}}$ decay rates, so measuring the time-dependent CP violation in penguin transition of  b $\rightarrow$ s and  b $\rightarrow$ d quarks (such as B $\rightarrow$ $\phi K^{0}$ and B $\rightarrow$ $\eta' K^{0}$). In fact this violation is predicted to be very small and so any significant observation can be interpreted as a signal beyond the SM.
	\item Also the CP violation in charm mixing, negligible in the SM, could draw attention to new phenomena in the up-type quark sector (up, charm, top).
	\item Another aspect that need to be understood is the large amount of CP violation in the time-integrated rates of charmless hadronic B decays, such as B $\rightarrow$ $K\pi$ and B $\rightarrow$ $K\pi \pi$, observed by LHCb and other B factories. 
	\end{itemize}

Conclusive measurements of time-dependent CP violation require a combination of data size and high precision measurement of $\Delta z$ (discussed further in section ''\nameref{vertex_decay}'' \vpageref{vertex_decay}), such as the distance between the tag and the signal in B meson decay vertices. In this respect, the upgrade of VXD could improve a lot the flavor tagging efficiency losses, due mainly to the beam-induced backgrounds, among others reasons.

\item[Multiple Higgs bosons:] Another relevant measurement is the Branching Ratio (BR) of the channel  B $\rightarrow$ $\tau\nu$, which is particularly sensitive to the charged Higgs boson (in addition to a neutral SM-like Higgs) that in general couples more strongly to heavier particles. Likewise the BR of the decay B $\rightarrow$ $D^{(*)}$$\tau\nu$, where BaBar, Belle and LHCb had already reported some anomalies. Extended Higgs mechanism could introduce extra sources of CP violation that we are looking for.\\
We could notice that semi-tauonic decay measurements like these, rely on efficient and full reconstruction of B mesons and so on the performance of VXD.


\item[Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC):]\
	\begin{itemize}
	%\itemsep0em
	\item The leading measurements suitable for this purpose are the time-dependent CP violation in B $\rightarrow$ $K^{*0}$($\rightarrow$ $K^{0}_{S}$ $\pi^{0}$)$\gamma$, triple product CP violation asymmetries in B $\rightarrow$ VV decays, and semileptonic decays B $\rightarrow$ V\textit{l}$\nu$, where V= $D^{*}$, $\rho$. 
	\item It is also essential to measure b $\rightarrow$ s$\nu\bar{\nu}$ transitions (such as B $\rightarrow$ $K^{(*)}\nu \bar{\nu}$) which belong to a class of decays with large missing energy and also improve FCNC measurements of b $\rightarrow$ d, b $\rightarrow$ s, and c $\rightarrow$ u transitions. 
	\end{itemize}
	
Most of the analyses with missing energy in the final state utilise hadronic or semileptonic B full reconstruction techniques and the succes of these methods is mostly dependent on low momentum track finding of VXD.

\item [Sources of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV):] LFV in charged lepton decay is a key prediction in many neutrinos mass generation mechanisms and other models of physics beyond the SM. Belle II has an unrivalled sensitivity to $\tau$ decays, because of their production in a clean $e^{+}e^{-}$ collision background and the large dataset available. The experiment analyzes $\tau$ leptons to search for LF and CP violation and to measure its electric dipole moment and (g-2) value.

\end{description}


\hspace{.2cm}

\textbf{NON FLAVOR PHISICS}

\begin{description}
\item[Dark Sector:] Belle II has a unique sensitivity to dark matter via missing energy decays. Although most researches for new physics are indirect, there are different model that predict the existance of new particles at the mass scale from MeV to TeV, that couple to the SM via new gauge asymmetries. They also predict a vast range of hidden particles, including dark matter candidates and new gauge bosons.

In these last two areas, $\tau$ and dark sectors physics, the aim is to probe forbidden and ultra-rare transition in low-multiplicity final states with as large dataset as possible. This mostly relies on trigger efficiency and strategies. Many of these processes can only be addressed by Belle II, so it is essential to increase the perfomance of the detector to improve the results.

\item[Binding Hadrons:] As time goes on, a large numbers of states not predicted by conventional mesons interpretation are discovered in other B factories and hadron colliders, changing our understanding of QCD in the low-energy regime. For this reason, study of quarkonia is a fundamental purpose for Belle II. In fact new particles can be produced near resonance, achievable by adjusting the machine energy or by intial state radiation, which effectively provides a continuum of center of mass energies. 

\item[CKM matrix:] Belle II is also dealing with the measurements of CKM observable, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision. 

\end{description}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



\subsection{B meson decay vertices} \label{vertex_decay}

The main task of VXD is to reconstruct the production and decay vertices of the particles originated from the beam collisions. This aspect is crucial to perform time-dependent measurements, core of the Belle II physics program, that we have briefly introduced in the previous.\\

The center of mass energy of Belle II experiment has its peak at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance, such as $\sqrt{s}$ = 10.58 GeV, which decays almost instantaneously into two B mesons ($B^{0}$ - $\bar{B}^{0}$) in nearly 96\% of all cases. The choice of the asymmetric configuration of the beams relies precisely in the requirement to boost the mesons in order to measure their life-time, exploiting the information on the distance between their decay vertices. In fact in a beam symmetric situation, they would have been produced at rest, decaying roughly at the same point or in any case at undetectable distances. The investigation of CP Violating processes instead, requires to measure the decay time difference of the two B mesons, and its uncertainty is dominated by that of decay vertex measurement (order of hundreds microns). Let us look at this in more details.\\

SuperKEKB collides an electrons beam of 7 GeV with a positrons beam of 4 GeV, chosen in order to have the center mass energy equal to 10.58 GeV. Indeed it must be valid:

\begin{align}
s = (p_{{e}^{-}}^{\mu} + p_{{e}^{+}}^{\mu}&)^{2}  = m^{2}_{\Upsilon(4S)}, \qquad with\  m_{e^{+/-}} \ll E_{{e}^{+/-}} \\ 
\centering
& \Rightarrow \quad 4E_{{e}^{-}}E_{{e}^{+}} = m^{2}_{\Upsilon(4S)}
\end{align}

So it's possible to compute the Lorentz boost of the mass center:

\begin{align}
\vec{P}_{\Upsilon(4S)} &= \vec{p}_{{e}^{-}} + \vec{p}_{{e}^{+}} = (\beta\gamma)_{\Upsilon(4S)}m_{\Upsilon(4S)} \approx 3 \ GeV \\  & \Rightarrow \  (\beta\gamma)_{\Upsilon(4S)} = \frac{3 \ GeV}{10.58 GeV} \approx 0.28
\end{align}

which is the same boost acquired by mesons, because they are produced almost at rest ($m_{\Upsilon(4S)}$ - $m_{2B_{0}}\approx$ 19 MeV). Moreover knowing that $\tau_{B}\simeq $\num{1.5e-12} s ans so c$\tau_{B}\simeq$ 450 $\mu$m, we can compute the average flight distance travelled before decaying:

\begin{equation}
\textit{l} = (\beta\gamma)_{\Upsilon(4S)}c\tau_{B} \approx 126 \mu m  
\end{equation} 

This value must be within the vertex detector sensitivity in order to distinguish the vertex decay and as consequence a precision measurements of lifetimes, mixing parameters and CP violation. The six-layer VXD could determine the position of the vertices with a precision better than 100 $\mu$m, allowing to reconstruct secondary vertices, i.e. the decay position of the particles coming from B decays, and also the $\tau$ and D mesons vertices.

Now let us take a closer look at the event kinematics (e.g. figure \vpageref{fig:decay_vertex}). The two B mesons are produced in an entangled quantum state, so from the decay products of the first it's possible to assign its flavor (for example $B^{0}$, identifyed as $B_{tag}^{0}$) and as consequence that of the second, which will be the opposite ($\bar{B}^{0}$, called $\bar{B}_{phys}^{0}$).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.7]{vertex_decay_1}
\caption{Example of the kinematics of the golden channel of Belle II experiment.}
\label{fig:decay_vertex}
\end{figure}

After this reconstruction, both B decay vertex positions $\textit{z}_{1}$ and $\textit{z}_{2}$ are evaluated, in order to compute their difference:

\begin{equation}
\Delta \textit{z} = \textit{z}_{1} - \textit{z}_{2} = (\beta\gamma)_{\Upsilon(4S)}c\Delta t
\end{equation}

where $\Delta t$ is the proper time decay difference. Therefore this topology allows to transform a temporal information in a spatial one that we are able to measure. Without the boosted center of mass none of it could be possible, and this is a main feature for an asymmetric B-factory.

\section{SuperKEKB accelerator}

Belle II sensitivity in the precision measurements that we sift throug in the previous, is feasible expecially thanks to the extraordinary performance of the SuperKEKB accelerator which host the (almost) hermetic detector. This complex facility is the result of efforts and efficient collaboration between the researches of KEK laboratory and all the international working groups that partecipate to the experiment.


\subsection{The facility}

SuperKEKB is an asymmetric $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider with a circumference of 3 km and a center of mass energy peak equal to  $\sqrt{s}$ = 10.58 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.
Compared to its predecessor KEKB (which started its operation in 1998 and concluded in 2010), the current accelerator has allowed to obtain the highest luminosity ever achieved, equal to \num{4.7e-34} $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ in July 2022. It was possible only by using a new scheme to accelerate and collide the beams, the so called \textit{nano-beam scheme}(section \vref{nano_beam}). Moreover a new upgrade of the machine, still under study, will also include other interventions expecially to cope with higher background levels, in view of further increase in luminosity.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{SuperKEKB2}
\caption{SuperKEKB accelerator structure.}
\label{fig:superkekb}
\end{figure}

We will briefly see the main features and parameters of the accelerator.\\


\textbf{Luminosity}\\

Istantaneous luminosity is one of the key parameters of any accelerator and it represents the interaction rate per unit of cross section between colliding particles. Reversing this equation is possible to obtain N, namely the number of the physical events produced in the interaction with a given luminosity:

\begin{equation}
L =\frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{dN}{dt}  \qquad   \Rightarrow \qquad  N = \int_{0}^{T} L\sigma dt
\end{equation}

where T is the duration of the experiment,  $\sigma$ the cross section of the physical process of interest.
Specifically luminosity is strictly dependent from both machine and beam parameters. With respect to this, it can be expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:luminosity_eq}
L = \frac{\gamma_{\pm}}{2er_{e}} \bigg(1 + \frac{\sigma_{y}^{*}}{\sigma_{x}^{*}} \bigg) \bigg(\frac{I_{\pm}\xi_{y\pm}}{\beta^{*}_{y}} \bigg) \bigg(\frac{R_{L}}{R_{\xi_{y\pm}}} \bigg)
\end{equation}

where ''$\pm$'' denotes respectively positrons and electrons, $\sigma_{x,y}^{*}$ is the beam size at the Interaction Point (IP) in the horizontal and vertical plane, $I$ is the beam current, $\beta_{y}^{*}$ the vertical beta function at the IP. $\xi_{y\pm}$ is the vertical beam parameter which include the horizontal beta function at the IP, the horizontal emittance, the bunch lenght and the crossing angle between the beams. $R_{L}$ and $R_{\xi_{y\pm}}$ are the reduction factors due to geometrical loss such as the hourglass effect and finite crossing.\\

As already mentioned, SuperKEKB holds the actual world record in luminosity (with $\beta^{*}_{y}$= 1.0 mm) and in the near future the target will be to reach \num{6.3e-35} $cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (by 2030), by increasing current beams and reducing their section in the IP, through the reduction of the betatron function to $\beta^{*}_{y}= 0.3$ mm. But this process makes the beam-induced background grow a lot, risking deterioration and not well-functioning of the detectors.

For these reasons the supervision of the beams background becomes crucial: right now it has been estimated that the background should remain accettable up to a luminosity value equal to \num{2.8e-35} $cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ with $\beta^{*}_{y}$= 0.6 mm.
So the chance to achieve higher luminosity is closely related to an upgrade plan of both the detector and the accelerator.

\hspace{.2cm}


\textbf{Beam energy}\\

Energy beams is mostly decided by the physics program interesting for the experiment. Currently SuperKEKB collides an electron beam with energy of 7 GeV (High Energy Ring, HER) , with a positron beam of 4 GeV (Low Energy Ring, LER), reaching a center of mass energy peaked to $\Upsilon$(4S) resonance.\\
The choice of colliding asymmetric beam (like its predecessor KEKB, which got collide electrons beam of 8 GeV with a positrons beam of 3.5 GeV) is necessary to identify and measure the decay vertices of particles created in the collisions, as we have seen in section \vref{vertex_decay}.\\
Indeed this mechanism allows to boost the decay products, improving the vertices reconstruction and increasing the sensitivity of the physics measurement, too.

In figure \vref{fig:beame} the flexibility of the energy of both LER and HER beams is showed, which provides a continuum of the center mass energy. The possible range covers energies which goes from the $\Upsilon$(1S) (9.46 GeV) resonance to the $\Upsilon$(6S) (11.24 GeV).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{beam_energy}
\caption{Beam energies to reach center of mass energy equal to $\Upsilon$(4S), $\Upsilon$(6S), 11.24 GeV and 12 GeV. Horizontal axis represents the energy of LER and the vertical one the energy of HER. }
\label{fig:beame}
\end{figure}


\subsection{''Nano-beam'' scheme} \label{nano_beam}

Another decisive factor to define the luminosity is the \textit{beta function} $\beta$ at the IP ($\beta^{*}$). To be able to increase luminosity, it's necessary to decrease the value of $\beta$ depending also, but not only, on the variation of the other machine parameters that appear in the equation \vref{eq:luminosity_eq}.
The mechanism used in SuperKEKB is called \textit{nano-beam scheme}, and it allowed to obtain luminosity 40 times greater than that of KEKB, managing to decrease of 1/20 the $\beta$ function in the IP.\\

This new scheme, designed by P. Raimondi, dictates that the beams have to collide at large angle, equal to 83 mrad in SuperKEKB (keeping beams divided through quadruople magnets), in order to reduce the \textit{hourglass effect}, which succeed when the bunches in the beam are much longer.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{nano_beam_scheme0}
\caption{Comparison between the beams scheme used in KEKB and SuperKEKB.}
\label{fig:beam_scheme_comparison}
\end{figure}

Using a crossing angle large enough, has other positive implications on the operation of the accelerator:

\begin{itemize}
\item allows the placement of a new focusing system in the IP with a superconducting quadrupole magnet;
\item allows to have two distinct line which host HER and LER beams;
\item diminishes the \textit{fringe fields} effect in the IP, wihch are the residuals of the magnets (magnetic fields) in the nearby. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Belle II detector}


Belle II detector is a general-purpose spectrometers, which consists of a series of nested subdetectors placed around the berillium beam pipe of 10 mm of radius, at the IP of the two beams. Here we will go trough a briefly description of the several subdetectors. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{belle_detector}
\caption{Belle II detector.}
\label{fig:belle_detector}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Vertex Detector (VXD)}


The \textbf{VerteX Detector (VXD)} is composed by two devices, the silicon Pixel Detector (PXD) and the Silicon Vertex Detector (SVD), for a total of six layers around the beam pipe.\\
The inner two layers of PXD (L12) consist of pixelated sensors based on the depleted field effect transistor (DEPFET) techonology, realised with very thin (< 100 $\mu$m) sensors, allowing to minimise multiple scattering, thus improving the tracking resolution for low-momentum particles. They are at a radius of 14 mm and 22 mm, respectively. \\
The remaining four layers of SVD (L3456) instead, are equipped with double-sided silicon strip (DSSD) sensors (at 39 mm, 80 mm, 104 mm and 135 mm respectively). Since a lower background rate is expected with respect to PXD, DSSD allow to achieve similar performance with a much smaller number of readout channels.
These layers are mainly used for tracking/vertexing and also for particle identification (dE/dx). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.7]{VXD}
\caption{A schematic view of the Belle II vertex detector with a Be beam pipe and the six layers of PXD and SVD.}
\label{fig:VXD}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Central Drift Chamber (CDC)}

It is the central tracking device, with a large-volume drift chamber and small drift cells. The chamber gas is composed of a \ch{He-C_{2}H_{6}} 50:50 mixture with an average drift velocity of 3.3 $\mu s^{-1}$ and a maximum drift time of about 350 ns for a 17 mm cell size.
The CDC contains 14336 wires  arranged in 56 layers either in \textit{axial}  (so aligned with the solenoidal magnetic field) or \textit{stereo} (skewed with respect to the axial wires) orientation. In fact by combining information from both the axial and the stereo layers it is possible to reconstruct a full three-dimensional helix charged tracks and measure their momenta.
It also provides information for particle identification by measuring ionization energy loss, which is particularly useful for low-momentum particles that cannot reach the outer subdetectors which deal with particle identification.

%IMMAGINE?

\subsection{Particle identification system (TOP e ARICH)}

%TOP QUELLO CHE PREOCCUPA MAGGIORMENTE PER BACKGROUND??
\textbf{TOP (Time Of Propagation)} is a special kind of Cherenkov detector used for particle identification in the barrel region. It employs the two-dimensional information of a Cherenkov ring image, such as the time of arrival and the impact position of Cherenkov photons at the photodetector at one end of a 2.6 m quartz bar. It is composed by 16 detector modules, each one consisted in a 45 x 2 cm quartz bar (Cherenkov radiator) with a small expansion volume (about 10 cm long) at the sensor end of the bar. In order to achieve a single-photon time resolution of about 100 ps (required for a good PID), 16-channel microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMT), specially developed for this purpose, are employed.\\
This detector is the one that creates the greatest concern for higher values of background. [?]

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\subfigure[A schematic view of the TOP radiator.]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{TOP_quartz_radiator}}\quad
\subfigure[A side view of the TOP radiator.]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{TOP_side_view}}\\
\caption{TOP detector.}
\label{TOP}
\end{figure}

\textbf{ARICH (Aerogel Ring Imaging CHerenkov)} is used to identify charged particle and it is placed in the forward endcap region. It is a proximity focusing Cherenkov ring imagine detector which adopts aerogel as Cherenkov radiator. In particular this detector employs a novel method to increase the number of detected Cherenkov photons: two 2 cm-thock layers of aerogel with different refractive indices ($n_{1}$ = 1.045 upstream, $n_{2}$= 1.055 downstream) that increase the yield without degrading the Cherenkov angle resolution.
A hybrid avalanche photon detector (HAPD) are exploited as single-photon-sensitive high-granularity sensor. Here photo-electrons are accelerated over a potential difference of about 8 KV and are detected in avalanches pyotodiodes (APD).\\

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.55]{ARICH}
\caption{ARICH detector.}
\label{ARICH}
\end{figure}

The main task of these detector is to improve the K/$\pi$ separation until 3.5 and 4 GeV/c of momentum, respectively.

\subsection{Electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL)}

The \textbf{ECL} is a highly segmented array of tallium-doped caesium iodide CsI(Tl) crystals assembled in a 3 m long barrel section with a radius of 1.25m, and two endcaps discs located at 2 m (forward) and 1 m (backward). All of them are instrumented with a total of 8736 crystal, covering about 90 \% of the solid angle in center-of-mass system. This detector is used to detect gamma rays and to identify electrons in order to separate the latter from hadrons, expecially pions.

\subsection{$K_{L}$ muon detector (KLM)}

It consists of an alternating sandwich of 4.7 cm-thick iron plates and active detector elements located outside the volume of the superconducting solenoid that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. The iron plates serve as the magnetic flux return joke for the solenoid. They also provide 3.9 interaction lenghts or more of material, beyond the 0.8 interaction lenghts of the calorimeter, in which $K_{L}^{0}$ mesons can shower hadronically. The active detector elements have been chosen in order to cope with the reduction of the detector efficiency under the SuperKEKB background rates: resistive plate chambers (RPCs) for the outermost active layers, and scintillator strip with wavelenght-shifting fibers, readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), in the two innermost layers of the barrel and endcaps regions.

\subsection{Trigger system}

The trigger system of Belle II has a non-trivial role to identify events of interest during data-taking at SuperKEKB, where high background rate are expected. 
This system is composed of two levels: a hardware-based low-level trigger (L1) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT), implemented in the data acquisition (DAQ) system. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{L1}: has a latency of 5 $\mu$s and a maximum trigger output rate of 30 kHz, limited by the read-in rate of the DAQ.
\item \textbf{HLT}: is a key component of the DAQ, used to fully reconstruct events that passed the L1 trigger selection. It has to reduce online event rates to 10 kHz for offline storage and it must identify track regions of interest for PXD readout in order to reduce data flux. It fully recreates events with offline reconstruction algorithms, using all detectors infromation except for the PXD.
\end{itemize}

\section{Current state and perspectives of data taking} \label{perspectives}

In further perspectives, the target of SuperKEKB is to achieve a new record with \textit{L} = \num{6e-35} $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ and to increase the integrated luminosity from 428 $fb^{-1}$ (actual value, starting in 2019) to 50 $fb^{-1}$, in order to increase the statistics and also the hope to give an insight in some of the opened questions in the SM.\\

To accomplish the fixed goals mentioned above, an upgrade not only of the vertex detector but of the whole experiment is necessary, among several reasons, to cope with a more complex circumstances due to the increased luminosity which undermine its proper functioning.

Therefore a three-phase program has been drawn up:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{short term}: year 2022. Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) is planned for approximately 15 months starting in July 2022, to install a complete pixel detector (PXD). Was it done?
\item \textbf{short term}: approximately year 2026-27. Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) will probably be needed for the upgrade of the Interaction Region (IR) to reach a new luminosity target $\textit{L}_{peak}$ = \num{6.5e-35} $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. A new Vertex Detector might be required to accommodate the new IR design, and other sub-detector upgrades are possible.
\item \textbf{long term}: years > 2032. Studies have started to explore upgrades beyond the currently planned program, such as beam polarization and ultra-high luminosity and so possibly $\textit{L}_{peak}$ in excess of \num{1e-36} $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. While the beam polarization has a concrete proposal, for ultra-high luminosity studies have just started.
\end{itemize}

At time of writing we are in the period of a long shut-down (LS1), last since June 2022 and the restart of data taking is planned at the beginning of 2024.
